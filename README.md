This project was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# What is this about?

It is a simple experiment, where I try to implement basic routing in React.

Apart from the packages provided by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) for styling and [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp) to parse the pathname as a regex, the project does not use any external packages.

# Try it out
1. `git clone git@github.com:robertistok/plain-react-experiment.git`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run start`

## Supports:
* component rendering based on the pathname
* dynamic params from the pathname passed down as props
* naigating using the back and forward buttons

## Todo:
- [ ] search query support
- [ ] programatic navigation
- [ ] adding pages dynamically
